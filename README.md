This is a repository for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.

It should contain three files:

1) run_analysis.R - the script used to produce the average_mean_and_sd.txt file (tidy data set).

2) Codebook.md - document describing variables and transformations used to derive the Averages file from the Smartphone Activity Recognition data set, along with a description of all output data columns.

3) README.md - this file

In order to execute the run_analysis.R script, both run_analysis.R and the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory must be in the current R working directory. Then enter: `source(run_analysis.R)`
